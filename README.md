# Time-series-Modeling-of-EU-Energy-Market

#Abstract


The increasing integration of renewable energy sources in European markets has resulted in frequent occurrences of negative electricity prices, posing challenges for market stability and profitability. This study presents a predictive framework that utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), and extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to analyze the duration and recovery of negative price events. By leveraging historical electricity price data, the model improves forecasting accuracy, enabling energy stakeholders to enhance risk management and strategic planning. Among the approaches explored, LSTM demonstrated strong predictive performance, effectively capturing temporal dependencies in electricity price fluctuations. The results highlight the potential of advanced machine learning and time series models in mitigating risks associated with negative price events, contributing to a more resilient and sustainable energy market.
